# Study Drills
# 1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name
# everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.
# 2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do
# not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.
